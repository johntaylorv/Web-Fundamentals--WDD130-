    <h2>JohnTaylor Vaillincourt</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is JohnTaylor. I've been in Rexburg as a student for a couple of years now with my wife, Emma. I'm interesting in UX Design as a career but I love reading, watching movies, playing video games, building things with my hands, longboarding and learning new skills. </p>
    <p>I enjoy school and taking classes but am looking forward to moving out of Rexburg. I am from New Hampshire and my wife from Alaska so we both enjoy more wooded and green areas. Emma recently graduated and I'll graduate in about a year. This class caught my eye as I know next to nothing about web design but have had many good friends enjoy it. </p>
